# Multiple Linear Regression with Scikit-learn

This repository demonstrates how to perform multiple linear regression using Python's `scikit-learn` library. The included Jupyter Notebook walks through the steps of building, evaluating, and interpreting a multiple linear regression model on a sample dataset.

## Contents

- `MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - SKLEARN.ipynb`  
  A hands-on notebook that covers:
  - Data loading and preparation
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Training a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn
  - Evaluating model performance
  - Visualizing results
  - Interpreting coefficients

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: Create and activate a virtual environment

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/POOJ888/MULTIPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION---SKLEARN.git
   cd MULTIPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION---SKLEARN
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
   Or use a `requirements.txt` file if provided.

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION - SKLEARN.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Preparation:** Import libraries, load the dataset, and preprocess features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Summarize and visualize relationships among variables.
- **Model Training:** Fit a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation:** Assess performance using metrics such as RÂ², MSE, and visualize predictions.
- **Interpretation:** Examine the meaning and impact of regression coefficients.

## Notes

- The notebook is fully commented for educational clarity.
- If you use your own data, make sure to update the data loading section accordingly.
- For reproducibility, set random seeds where applicable.
- If you encounter missing data errors, check your dataset and preprocess as needed.
